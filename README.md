Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This Tic-Tac-Toe Web App is a simple yet elegant implementation of the classic two-player game.
It is designed to be lightweight, fully responsive, and visually attractive with smooth animations and a modern UI.
Players alternate between "X" and "O" until one wins by aligning three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — or the game ends in a draw!
